# Demo API

Demo API template includes all the common packages and setup used for API development in this Company.

## Development

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update according to requirement.
- Create `serviceAccountKey.json` file for firebase admin sdk.
- To run `docker-compose up` (with default configuration will run at `5000` and adminer runs at `5001`)

## Swagger docs config
**Note:** client will generate schema from swagger docs so, please follow these configurations

- ### Struct

  - use **validate:"required"** tag to insure generated fields/keys are not null/optional.
    ```go
    type User struct {
        Name string  `json:"name" validate:"required"`
    }
    ```
    will be generated as
    ```ts
    interface User {
        name: string
    }
    ```
    else
    ```ts
    interface User {
        name?: string
    }
    ```


- ### Function Comments

  - Using `// @Tags` for User and Admin Access endpoints
    - For easy navigation and understanding, utilize distinct @Tags values for endpoints accessible by users and admins. For instance, 
    - use: 
      - ``// @Tags UserApi`` for endpoints under /users accessible to regular users.
      - ``// @Tags UserManagementApi`` for endpoints under /users restricted to administrative access.


## Run CLI üñ•

- Run `docker-compose exec web sh`
- After running type `./__debug_bin cli` you will start cli application.
- Choose the commands to run afterwards.
- To run `docker-compose up` ( with default configuration will run at 5000 and adminer runs at 5001)
- To run with setting up pre-commit hook `make start` ( with default configuration will run at 5000 and adminer runs at 5001`)
